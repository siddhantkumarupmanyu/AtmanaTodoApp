considering no data as Success too, in this case list is just empty

api return same data for page 1 and page 0

let store current FetchedPage in RemoteViewModel only


since this is not a complicated project and pdf does not mention anything
    - not going with Single Source Of Truth for RemoteData

what is with this avatar thing
    - TBH, I do not want to use two different list layout.
    - I have no problem with loading images, 4 lines of glide and it will work
    - ignoring/skipping for now
