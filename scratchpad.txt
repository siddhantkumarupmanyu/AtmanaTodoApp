Not Going to add ProgressBar, this case is getting much complkicated and deadline is less
    - as challenge says just adding a load more textview
        - will load new data when clicked on it.

actually loadingMore should be considered different than Initial Loading
    - this makes the loading progressBar at the end easy but see above
    - ignoring that for now

considering no data as Success too, in this case list is just empty

api return same data for page 1 and page 0

let store current FetchedPage in RemoteViewModel only


since this is not a complicated project and pdf does not mention anything
    - not going with Single Source Of Truth for RemoteData

what is with this avatar thing
    - TBH, I do not want to use two different list layout.
    - I have no problem with loading images, 4 lines of glide and it will work
    - ignoring/skipping for now
