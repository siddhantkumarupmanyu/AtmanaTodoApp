// LOCAL


// REMOTE (will complete it after Local)

there are two ways to show no data is available
    - one is to fetch the next page before hand and then show appropriately
    - second is to fetch the next page on demand <- going with this one
        - so it's something like this
            - user clicks on LoadMore -> if data is available we load it, if it's not we just say no more data available

Not Going to add ProgressBar, that case is getting much complicated and deadline is less
    - as challenge says just adding a load more textview
        - will load new data when clicked on it.

actually loadingMore should be considered different than Initial Loading
    - ignoring this for now
    - this makes the loading progressBar at the end easy but see above

api return same data for page 1 and page 0


since this is not a complicated project and pdf does not mention anything
    - not going with Single Source Of Truth for RemoteData

what is with this avatar thing
    - TBH, I do not want to use two different list layout.
    - I have no problem with loading images, 4 lines of glide and it will work
    - ignoring/skipping for now
